    <p>Wenger was named manager of <a href = "https://www.arsenal.com/">Arsenal</a>
      in 1996 and two years later led the
      club to a league and FA Cup double. The club won another league and cup
      double in 2002 and retained the FA Cup a year later. In 2004, Wenger
       managed Arsenal to an <b>undefeated league season</b>, a feat last accomplished
       by Preston North End, 115 years previously. Arsenal later eclipsed
       Nottingham Forest's record of 42 league matches unbeaten and went seven
       more matches before losing in October 2004. The club made their first
       appearance in a Champions League final in 2006, though they lost to Barcelona.
       After a period of almost nine years without a trophy, which coincided
       with the club relocating to the Emirates Stadium, Wenger guided Arsenal
       to further FA Cup success in 2014, 2015 and 2017.</p>
